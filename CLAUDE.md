# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**MTGA Arena Collection Scanner** - A full-stack web application for scanning and digitizing Magic: The Gathering Arena collection screenshots using OCR and AI.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **Screenshot Upload**: Drag-and-drop interface for MTG Arena collection screenshots
- **OCR Processing**: Extracts card names from screenshots using Tesseract.js
- **AI Correction**: Uses Anthropic Claude API (Sonnet 4.5) to correct OCR errors in card names
- **Card Validation**: Validates card names against Scryfall database
- **Quantity Detection**: Automatically detects card quantities from diamond indicators
- **Grid Detection**: Detects 12-column x 3-row card layout (36 cards per page)
- **Interactive Results**: Editable table for manual corrections
- **Export**: CSV and JSON export functionality
- **Accuracy Testing**: Load test data and compare against OCR results

### Calibration System
- **Interactive Grid Calibrator**: Draggable/resizable overlay for positioning the card grid
  - Green outline with corner handles for drag/resize
  - Blue boxes showing all 36 individual card slots
  - Card gap adjustment sliders for horizontal/vertical spacing
- **OCR Region Calibration**: Adjust where OCR reads card names within each card
  - Red boxes show live preview of OCR regions
  - Four sliders: Left Offset, Top Offset, Width, Height
  - Updates in real-time on all 36 cards
- **Persistent Settings**: All calibration values saved to localStorage

### Progress Tracking
- **Real-time Progress Indicator** (always visible during processing):
  - Visual progress bar showing percentage completion
  - Card counter (e.g., "Processing Cards: 9/36")
  - Page indicator when processing multiple screenshots (e.g., "Page: 2/5")
  - Current phase indicator (OCR / AI Correction / Card Validation / Complete)
  - Batch progress (e.g., "Batch: 2/9")
  - Current card details with name and position
  - Auto-hides 2 seconds after completion

### Multi-Page Processing
- **Process Multiple Screenshots**: Upload and process multiple collection pages in one session
- **Page Number Tracking**: Each card tracks which screenshot/page it came from
- **Page Filtering**: Dropdown to filter results by individual pages or view all together
- **Collection Summary**:
  - Total cards, unique cards, total quantity across all pages
  - Average confidence score
  - Per-page breakdown showing card count and quantity for each page
  - Scryfall match statistics
- **Auto-Validation**: Only cards validated by Scryfall are included in results
  - Empty slots and OCR errors are automatically filtered out
  - Unmatched cards are logged to console with warning for review
  - Scryfall fuzzy matching handles most OCR typos

### AI Correction (Optional/Disabled)
- **Current Status**: AI correction via Anthropic Claude is currently disabled
- **Reason**: Scryfall's fuzzy matching handles most OCR errors effectively
- **When to Enable**: If you see many unmatched cards in console warnings, AI correction can help
- **Location**: See `src/services/anthropic.ts` to re-enable if needed

### Debug Mode
- Enable via checkbox to access calibration tools
- Live preview canvas showing grid and OCR regions
- Card numbering (1-36) for easy reference
- **Real-time processing visualization** with color-coded status indicators:
  - ðŸŸ¡ Yellow = Currently processing
  - ðŸŸ¢ Green = Successfully extracted
  - ðŸ”´ Red = Error occurred
  - âšª Gray = Empty slot

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **OCR**: Tesseract.js (parallel processing with 4 workers)
- **AI**: Anthropic Claude API (Sonnet 4.5)
- **Card Database**: Scryfall API
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (currently disabled for development)

## Data Format

The CSV export format includes:
- **Nummer**: Card number/ID (1-36)
- **Position X**: Column position (1-12)
- **Position Y**: Row position (1-3)
- **Kartenname**: Card name
- **Anzahl**: Quantity owned (1-4)

Cards are arranged in a 12-column x 3-row grid (36 cards per screenshot), with gaps between cards.

## Development Setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Open: http://localhost:5173

## Environment Variables

Create `.env` file:
```
VITE_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_key
```

## Calibration Values (Defaults)

### Grid Parameters (saved to localStorage)
- `startX`: 0.027 (2.7% from left edge)
- `startY`: 0.193 (19.3% from top edge)
- `gridWidth`: 0.945 (94.5% of image width)
- `gridHeight`: 0.788 (78.8% of image height)
- `cardGapX`: 0.008 (0.8% horizontal gap between cards)
- `cardGapY`: 0.036 (3.6% vertical gap between cards)

### OCR Region Parameters (saved to localStorage)
- `ocrLeft`: 0.05 (5% from card left edge)
- `ocrTop`: 0.043 (4.3% from card top edge)
- `ocrWidth`: 0.80 (80% of card width)
- `ocrHeight`: 0.075 (7.5% of card height)

### Quantity Detection Parameters (saved to localStorage)
- `offsetX`: 0.28 (28% from left edge of card - centers on diamond region)
- `offsetY`: 0.08 (8% above card)
- `width`: 0.44 (44% of card width - focuses on diamond indicators)
- `height`: 0.07 (7% of card height)
- `brightnessThreshold`: 50 (max brightness for dark pixels)
- `saturationThreshold`: 10 (max saturation for grey/neutral pixels)
- `fillRatioThreshold`: 0.05 (5% - minimum % of zone pixels to count as filled)

**Algorithm**: Splits diamond region into 4 horizontal zones. For each zone, counts pixels that are BOTH dark (brightness < 50) AND grey (saturation < 10). If zone has >5% dark-grey pixels, it's counted as filled. Filled diamonds have near-black filling; empty diamonds are transparent showing background color.

**Important**: Quantity detection uses the ORIGINAL unmodified image, not the preprocessed canvas. The preprocessImage function applies contrast enhancement (1.5x factor) which changes pixel values and would break quantity detection thresholds. OCR uses the preprocessed canvas for better text recognition.

## Usage Workflow

1. Upload MTG Arena collection screenshot
2. (Optional) Enable Debug Mode and calibrate:
   - **Section 1**: Grid positioning and card spacing
   - **Section 2**: OCR name region positioning
   - **Section 3**: Quantity detection calibration with real-time preview
3. Click "Process" to extract card data
4. Review and manually edit results if needed
5. (Optional) Load test data to check accuracy
6. Export to CSV or JSON

## Known Issues

- Authentication is currently disabled (line 154-156 in App.tsx)
- OCR works best with high-resolution screenshots
- localStorage migration may require manual clearing if old parameters persist

## Implementation Details

### Image Processing Pipeline
CardProcessor (src/components/Processing/CardProcessor.tsx) uses TWO separate canvases:
1. **Preprocessed canvas** - Used for OCR with contrast enhancement for better text recognition
2. **Original canvas** - Used for quantity detection to preserve accurate pixel values

This separation is critical because the preprocessImage function (src/services/ocr.ts) applies a 1.5x contrast enhancement that modifies all RGB values, which would break the brightness/saturation thresholds used in quantity detection.

### Parallel OCR Processing
The OCR service (src/services/ocr.ts) uses a worker pool for parallel processing:
- **4 parallel Tesseract workers** initialized simultaneously
- Cards processed in **batches of 4** using Promise.all()
- Round-robin worker allocation for balanced load distribution
- **~75% faster** than sequential processing (13-15s vs 50-60s for 36 cards)

Processing flow:
1. Initialize 4 OCR workers at startup
2. Split 36 cards into 9 batches of 4
3. Process each batch in parallel (4 cards at once)
4. Maintain original card order in results
5. Update progress after each batch completes
6. Visual indicators update in real-time (debug mode only)

### Visual Processing Indicators
When debug mode is enabled, the system displays real-time processing status:
- **Live canvas overlay** shows the original screenshot with status overlays
- **Color-coded borders** (4px width) indicate processing state
- **Translucent fills** (10-15% opacity) keep cards visible underneath
- **Card numbers** displayed in top-left corner of each card
- Updates **before each batch** (yellow highlights) and **after each batch** (green/red/gray)
- Persists final state after completion for review
