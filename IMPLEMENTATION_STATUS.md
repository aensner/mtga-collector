# Implementation Status - Deck-First Architecture

## ✅ Completed (Phase 1 - Database Integration)

### Database Layer
- ✅ Database schema created (`supabase/migrations/20250114000001_create_decks_tables.sql`)
  - `decks` table with RLS policies
  - `deck_cards` table with card metadata caching
  - Auto-triggers for deck statistics (total_cards, is_valid)
  - Indexes on user_id, format, scryfall_id
- ✅ TypeScript types defined (`src/types/index.ts`)
  - `Deck`, `DeckCard`, `DeckSummary` interfaces
  - `DeckFormat`, `DeckArchetype` enums
- ✅ Database service layer (`src/services/deckDatabase.ts`)
  - CRUD operations: create, read, update, delete
  - Bulk card upsert with saveDeckCards()
  - Ownership percentage calculations
  - Collection matching for deck loading

### UI Components
- ✅ My Decks dashboard (`src/components/Decks/MyDecks.tsx`)
  - Grid view of deck cards with stats
  - Ownership progress bars with color coding
  - Format and archetype badges
  - Quick actions: View, Edit, Delete
  - Color identity indicators (⚪🔵⚫🔴🟢)
  - Empty state with "Create Deck" CTA
- ✅ App navigation updated (`src/App.tsx`)
  - Three-tab navigation: 🏠 My Decks → 🎴 Build Deck → 📚 Collection
  - Deck editing flow (select deck → navigate to builder with deckId)
- ✅ DeckBuilder database integration (`src/components/DeckBuilder/DeckBuilder.tsx`)
  - Async save/load operations
  - Dual persistence (Supabase + localStorage backup)
  - Create new decks or update existing
  - Collection matching on load
  - Missing card tracking
- ✅ Collection View enhancements (`src/components/DeckBuilder/CollectionView.tsx`)
  - **Default "I Own" filter**: Shows only available cards
  - Ownership filter options:
    - ✓ I Own (Available)
    - 📋 Already in Deck
    - ⭐ Not Yet Added
    - Show All Cards
  - Visual ownership badges (green "x#" indicators)
  - Prominent filter placement

### Documentation
- ✅ Product vision documented (`docs/PRODUCT_VISION.md`)
- ✅ UX design specifications (`docs/UX_DESIGN.md`)
- ✅ User flow diagrams (`docs/USER_FLOWS.md`)
- ✅ Migration instructions (`MIGRATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`)
- ✅ Migration verification script (`apply-deck-migration.mjs`)

## ⚠️ Pending - Requires User Action

### Database Migration
**Status**: SQL created but not yet applied to Supabase

**Action Required**:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor:
   ```
   https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/djkhfkzzvcnnzdlwpxiq/sql
   ```
2. Create new query
3. Copy contents from `supabase/migrations/20250114000001_create_decks_tables.sql`
4. Execute query
5. Verify with: `node apply-deck-migration.mjs`

**Why Manual**: Automated migration (`npm run db:migrate`) conflicts with existing migrations.

## 🔄 Next Steps (Phase 2 - AI Enhancement)

### AI Deck Suggestions
- [ ] Update AI Assistant to suggest card additions based on deck archetype
- [ ] Add "Optimize Deck" button that uses AI to recommend improvements
- [ ] Implement card replacement suggestions
- [ ] Add sideboard recommendations

### One-Click Deck Creation
- [ ] Visual profile selector (Aggro, Control, Midrange, Combo)
- [ ] AI-powered complete deck generation from profile
- [ ] Auto-save generated decks with descriptive names
- [ ] Show ownership percentage immediately after generation

### Enhanced Deck Statistics
- [ ] Add DeckStatistics component showing:
  - Mana curve histogram
  - Color distribution pie chart
  - Card type breakdown
  - Average CMC
- [ ] Integrate CardPreview component for deck cards

## 📝 Testing Checklist

Once migration is applied, test these workflows:

### First-Time User Flow
- [ ] Land on My Decks (empty state)
- [ ] Click "Create First Deck"
- [ ] Navigate to Build Deck tab
- [ ] Create deck with cards from collection
- [ ] Save deck
- [ ] Verify deck appears in My Decks

### Returning User Flow
- [ ] Land on My Decks (shows saved decks)
- [ ] View ownership percentages
- [ ] Click Edit on existing deck
- [ ] Modify deck cards
- [ ] Save changes
- [ ] Verify updates reflected in My Decks

### Collection Update Flow
- [ ] Upload new collection screenshot (Collection tab)
- [ ] Process and validate cards
- [ ] Return to My Decks
- [ ] Verify ownership percentages updated

### Ownership Filter Testing
- [ ] Open Build Deck with existing deck
- [ ] Default filter: "I Own (Available)"
  - Should show only cards with available copies
  - Should hide cards fully used in deck
- [ ] Switch to "Already in Deck"
  - Should show only cards currently in deck
- [ ] Switch to "Not Yet Added"
  - Should show owned cards not in deck
- [ ] Switch to "Show All Cards"
  - Should show entire collection

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Pre-existing TypeScript Errors
These errors exist in the codebase but are unrelated to deck-first implementation:
- `src/components/Processing/QuantityCalibrator.tsx`: Unused variables, type mismatch
- `src/services/imageProcessing.ts`: Unused variables
- `src/services/ocr.ts`: Property access errors, unused functions

**Impact**: None - these files are not used in deck-first architecture

### Build Warnings
- CRLF line ending warnings on Windows (Git auto-conversion)
- Does not affect functionality

## 📊 Git Commit History

Recent commits implementing deck-first architecture:

1. `452e5fe` - Add ownership filters and indicators to deck builder collection view
2. `64eadbf` - Integrate Supabase database persistence for deck storage
3. `85f2f61` - Implement deck-first architecture with My Decks dashboard
4. `e7942b7` - Enhance AI deck builder with visual profiles and one-click deck creation
5. `252a994` - Add user_settings table migration for remote Supabase database

## 🚀 Performance Considerations

- **Database Queries**: Optimized with indexes on user_id and scryfall_id
- **RLS Policies**: Ensures security with minimal performance impact
- **Auto-Triggers**: Deck statistics updated automatically without client-side recalculation
- **Dual Persistence**: Supabase primary, localStorage backup for offline access
- **Ownership Calculations**: Performed server-side or at load time, not on every render

## 🎯 Success Metrics

Once Phase 2 is complete, measure:
- Time from landing page to first deck created (target: < 2 minutes)
- Percentage of users who use AI deck suggestions (target: > 60%)
- Deck ownership percentage at creation (target: > 75%)
- Collection scanner usage frequency (should decrease after initial setup)
